Heyyyy, remember that thing everyone did like 6 months ago... you may remember i posted a couple of wips back in uhhhhh April? May? but I just couldn’t get myself to draw all 6. Tfw when 6 is too much hahah. It was a rough time for me.

ANYWAY i’ve been feeling a little better lately, and would you look at that — i managed to draw! And i enjoyed it! Fuck, i missed that feeling so much.

This is 100% NOT what i’m supposed to be working on, which is storyboarding, but it’s fine. It’s fine. Baby steps.

Aeryn was a freebie from me to me, I had a free slot and was feeling nostalgic for the time she was all I ever drew :’). And i still can’t draw her right. I feel bad I made Fenris sad, I always draw him sad when I don’t pay attention :(
