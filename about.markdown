**I am a digital artist with a penchant for character concept art and character illustration, and a focus on colour and narrative.**

I’ve been working freelance since 2013, focusing on 2D illustrative art, and contributed to various projects including several independently published books and art anthologies.

I currently live, draw, and play RPGs in Belgrade, Serbia, with my partner and the feline embodiment of Soryu Asuka Langley.
